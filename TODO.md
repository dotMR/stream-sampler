// TODO:
// links to make info clearer (app > repository)
// easily populate random file on form (small button?)
// link to test harness more prominent

// force reset between runs (move results to last run components?)
// update top n samples in analysis to be same as sample size
// flow samples across
// move generator to test
// show test harness results on page rather than alert

// run tests from test page, not automatically
//	-> then can show status on page.
	-> how to show results?

// problems with not using state in some components (variables instead?)
